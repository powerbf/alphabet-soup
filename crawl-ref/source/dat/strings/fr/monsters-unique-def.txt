# Monsters - unique, definite article, nominative
#
###############################################################################

# Notes:
#
# It might seem weird to list named monsters with the definite article, but it's
# needed for messages like: "You hit the helpless Sigmund." Also, it's easier to
# generate the "plain" version (without article) from the one with the article
# than the other way round because it's very hard to identify plain unique names
# (there are hundreds of other one-word strings that start with a capital
# letter).
#
# Some uniques are gender-neutral in English. This is different to neuter.
# (neuter -> it, gender neutral -> they). This can not be done in French, so we
# revert to their previous genders.
