welcome

<white>Welcome to Dungeon Crawl!</white>

Your objective is to lead your <w>{{ return you.race() }} {{ return you.class()
}}</w> safely through the depths of the dungeon, retrieving the fabled Orb of
Zot and returning it to the surface. In the beginning, however, let discovery
be your main goal. Try to delve as deeply as possible but beware; death lurks
around every corner.

For the moment, just remember the following keys and their functions:
  <input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]?</input> — shows the items and the commands
  <input>$cmd[CMD_SAVE_GAME]</input>  — saves the game, to be resumed later
(but note that death is permanent)
  <input>$cmd[CMD_LOOK_AROUND]</input>  — examines something in your vicinity

The hint mode will help you play Crawl without reading any documentation. If
you haven't yet, you might want to try out the tutorial. Also, if you feel
intrigued, there is more information available in the following files from the
docs/ directory (all of which can also be read in-game):
  <lightblue>quickstart.txt</lightblue>     — A very short guide to Crawl.
  <lightblue>crawl_manual.txt</lightblue>   — This contains all details on
species, magic, skills, etc.
  <lightblue>options_guide.txt</lightblue>  — Crawl's interface is highly
configurable. This document explains all the options.

Happy Crawling!
%%%%
death

Condolences! Your character's premature death is a sad, but common occurrence
in Crawl. Rest assured that with diligence and playing experience your
characters will last longer.

Perhaps the following advice can improve your playing style:
%%%%
death conjurer melee

As a Conjurer your main weapon should be offensive magic. Cast spells more
often! Remember to rest when your Magic is low.
%%%%
death berserker unberserked

Don't forget to go berserk when fighting particularly difficult foes. It's
risky, but makes you faster and beefier.
%%%%
death ranger melee

Your bow and arrows are extremely powerful against distant monsters. Be sure to
collect all arrows lying around in the dungeon.
%%%%
death random 0

Always consider using projectiles, wands or spells before engaging monsters in
close combat.
%%%%
death random 1

Learn when to run away from things you can't handle — this is important! It is
often wise to skip a particularly dangerous level. But don't overdo this as
monsters will only get harder the deeper you delve.
%%%%
death random 2

Rest between encounters, if possible in an area already explored and cleared of
monsters. Pressing <input>$cmd[CMD_REST]</input><localtiles>, or
<input>clicking on the 'rest' button in the command bar'</input></localtiles>
will rest for 100 turns, or until fully healed.
%%%%
death random 3

Remember to use those scrolls, potions or wands you've found. Learn to
improvise: identify your items by using them.
%%%%
death random 4

If a particular encounter feels overwhelming, don't forget to use emergency
items early on. A scroll of teleportation or a potion of haste can really save
your bacon.
%%%%
death random 5

Never fight more than one monster, if you can help it. Always back into a
corridor so that they are forced to fight you one on one.
%%%%
finished

Congrats! You survived until the end of the hint mode — be sure to try the
other ones as well. Note that the command help screen
(<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]?</input>) will look very different from now
on. Here's a last playing hint:
%%%%
finished explored

Walking around and exploring levels gets easier by using auto-explore
(<input>$cmd[CMD_EXPLORE]</input>). Crawl will let you automatically move to
and pick up interesting items.<localtiles>

Autoexploration can also be started by <input>Ctrl-Leftclick</input> on the
minimap.</localtiles>
%%%%
finished travel

There is a convenient way to travel between distant dungeon levels: press
<input>$cmd[CMD_INTERLEVEL_TRAVEL]</input> and enter the desired destination.
If your travel gets interrupted, issuing <input>$cmd[CMD_INTERLEVEL_TRAVEL]
Enter</input> will continue it.
%%%%
finished stashes

You can search among all items existing in the dungeon with the
<input>$cmd[CMD_SEARCH_STASHES]</input> command. For example,
<input>$cmd[CMD_SEARCH_STASHES]</input> <w>“dagger”</w> will list all daggers,
and allow you to travel to them. You can even search for dungeon features, like
<w>“shop”</w> or <w>“altar”</w>.
%%%%
finished random 0

The game keeps an automated log for your characters. Use
<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]:</input> to read it. Once your character
perishes, two morgue files are left in the <w>morgue/</w> directory. The one
ending in .txt contains a copy of your log. During play, you can create a dump
file with <input>$cmd[CMD_CHARACTER_DUMP]</input>.
%%%%
finished random 1

Crawl has a macro function built in: press <input>~m</input> to define a macro
by first specifying a trigger key (say, <input>F1</input>) and a command
sequence, for example <input>za.</input>. The latter will make the
<input>F1</input> key always zap the spell in slot a at the nearest monster.
For more information on macros, type
<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]~</input>.
%%%%
finished random 2

The interface can be greatly customised. All options are explained in the file
<w>options_guide.txt</w> which can be found in the <w>docs</w> directory. The
options themselves are set in <w>init.txt</w> or <w>.crawlrc</w>. Crawl will
complain if it can't find either file.
%%%%
finished random 3

You can ask other Crawl players for advice and help on the <w>##crawl</w> IRC
(Internet Relay Chat) channel on freenode (<w>irc.freenode.net</w>).
%%%%
dissection reminder

Don't forget that you can butcher corpses with <input>$cmd[CMD_BUTCHER]</input>
<localtiles>, or by clicking on corpses in the floor part of your inventory
with the <input>left mouse button</input></localtiles>.
%%%%
HINT_CONVERT Xom

You've just converted to worshipping <w>Xom</w>. As a follower of Xom, you'll
be treated like a plaything, randomly helped or harmed for Xom's own amusement.

There is no way to guarantee Xom remains in a good mood - the best any follower
can hope for is to avoid letting Xom grow bored!
%%%%
HINT_CONVERT Gozag

You've just converted to worshipping <w>Gozag</w>. Unlike other gods, Gozag only
cares about gold; each divine power costs gold, and they grow more expensive
with use. Still, that gold won't do you any good if you're dead, and Gozag's
Potion Petition can be a huge help in combat!
%%%%
HINT_CONVERT Ru

You've just converted to worshipping <w>Ru</w>. Unlike other gods, Ru grants
piety (divine favour) in exchange for personal sacrifices, like giving up your
ability to drink potions while endangered; the more piety you have, the more
abilities Ru will grant, and the more powerful those abilities will become.
Ru will offer sacrifices as you explore the depths of the dungeon.
%%%%
HINT_CONVERT

You've just converted to worshipping <w>{{ return you.god() }}</w>. Your piety
(divine favour) will increase as you do things to please your new god, and will
gradually decrease over time.

You can check your god's likes and dislikes, as well as your current standing
and divine abilities, by typing
<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_RELIGION]</input><localtiles>, or by pressing
<input>Shift-right-click</input> on your avatar</localtiles>.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_FIRST_OBJECT

That <console>$1 </console>is an item. If you move there and press
<input>$cmd[CMD_PICKUP]</input><tiles>, or <input>left-click</input> on it in
your inventory</tiles>, you will pick it up.<console> Generally, items
are shown by non-letter symbols like <w>%?!"=()[</w>.</console> Some
objects<tiles>, marked with a green frame,</tiles> will be picked up
automatically.

Once it is in your inventory, you can drop it again with <tiles>a
<input>Shift-left-click</input>. Whenever you <input>right-click</input> on an
item</tiles><console><input>$cmd[CMD_DROP]</input>. Any time you look at an
item in your inventory (<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_INVENTORY]</input>)</console>,
you can read about its properties and its description.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_POTION

You have picked up your first potion<console> ('<w>$item[potion]</w>').
Use </console><tiles>. Simply <w>left-click</w> on it, or press </tiles>
<w>$cmd[CMD_QUAFF]</w> to quaff it.

Once you've identified a potion, either with a scroll of identification or by
drinking it, you'll automatically recognize all other potions of the same type;
this means it's sometimes useful to drink potions just to identify them.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_SCROLL

You have picked up your first scroll<console> ('<w>$item[scroll]</w>')
Press </console><tiles>. Simply <w>left-click</w> on it, or press </tiles>
<w>$cmd[CMD_READ]</w> to read it.

Once you've identified a scroll, either with a scroll of
identification or by reading it, you'll automatically
recognize all other scrolls of the same type; this means
it's sometimes useful to read scrolls just to identify them.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_WAND

You have picked up your first wand<console> ('<w>$item[wand]</w>').
Press </console><tiles>. Simply <w>left-click</w> on it, or press </tiles>
<w>$cmd[CMD_EVOKE]</w> to evoke it.

If you find more wands of the same type, they'll merge into this wand and add
charges to it.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_SPBOOK

You have picked up a book<console> ('<w>$item[book]'</w>) </console>. If it's a
spellbook, its spells are immediately added to your library on pickup. You'll
be able to memorise spells from it via <w>$cmd[CMD_MEMORISE_SPELL]</w>, and cast
them with <w>$cmd[CMD_CAST_SPELL]</w>.
{{
    if you.god() == "Trog" then
        return "Trog hates it when you memorise or study magic, though!"
    end
}}
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_WEAPON

This is the first weapon<console>('<w>$item[weapon]</w>')</console> you've
picked up. Use <w>$cmd[CMD_WIELD_WEAPON]</w><tiles> or
<w>left-click</w> on it</tiles> to wield it, but be aware that this
weapon might train a different skill from your current one. You can view the
weapon's properties from your
<w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_INVENTORY]</w>nventory<localtiles> or by 
<w>right-clicking</w> on it</localtiles>.

{{
    if you.class() == "Berserker" then
        return "You should probably stick with axes. Checking other axes'"
               .. " enchantments can be worthwhile, though!"
    end
}}
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_MISSILES

This is the first stack of missiles<console> ('<w>$item[missile]</w>')</console>
you've picked up. Missiles like boomerangs and throwing nets can be thrown by
hand, but other missiles like arrows and bolts require a launcher and training
in using it to be really effective.
<localtiles><w>Right-click</w> on</localtiles><nomouse>Select</nomouse>
the item in your <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_INVENTORY]</w>nventory to see more
information about both missiles and launcher.

{{
    if you.class() == "Hunter" then
        return "As you're already trained in Bows, you only need to bother"
               .." collecting arrows."
    elseif you.class() == "Conjurer" then
        return "However, as a spellslinger, you don't really need another type"
               .. " of ranged attack."
    else
        return "For now you might be best off sticking with stones for ranged"
               .. " attacks."
    end
}}
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_ARMOUR

This is the first piece of armour<console> ('<w>$item[armour]</w>')</console>
you've picked up. <localtiles>You can click on it to wear it, and click again
to remove it. <w>Right-clicking</w> on it will give more information.
</localtiles><nomouse>Use <w>$cmd[CMD_WEAR_ARMOUR]</w> to wear it and

properties from your <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_INVENTORY]</w>nventory.
</nomouse>

{{
    if you.get_base_mutation_level("horns") > 0 then
        return "Note that because of your horns you will be unable to wear"
               .. " helmets. (Press <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_MUTATIONS]</w> to see"
               .. " a list of your mutations and innate abilities.)"
    end
}}
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_RANDART

Weapons and armour that have unusual descriptions like this are much more likely
to be of higher enchantment or have special properties, good or bad.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_CARRION

That<console> <w>$item[corpse]</w></console> is a corpse.
%%%%
HINT_NON_FLOOR_CARRION

Ah, a corpse!
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_JEWELLERY

You have picked up a piece of jewellery, either a ring
<console>('<w>$item[jewellery]</w>') </console>or an 
amulet<console> ('<w>$item[amulet]</w>'). Press
<w>$cmd[CMD_WEAR_JEWELLERY]</w> to put it on and 
<w>$cmd[CMD_REMOVE_JEWELLERY]</w> to remove it. You can view its properties
from your <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_INVENTORY]</w>nventory.</console>
<tiles>. You can click on it to put it on, and click again
to remove it. By <w>right-clicking</w> on it, you can view its
properties.</tiles>
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_MISC

This is a curious object indeed. You can play around with it to find out what
it does by <localtiles>clicking on it to e<w>$cmd[CMD_EVOKE]</w>oke </localtiles>
<console>e<w>$cmd[CMD_EVOKE]</w>oking </console>it. As usual, selecting it from
your <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_INVENTORY]</w>nventory might give you more information.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_STAFF

You have picked up a magic staff<console> ('<w>$item[magical staff]</w>')</console>.
It must be <w>$cmd[CMD_WIELD_WEAPON]</w>ielded to be of use. Magicians use
staves to increase their power in certain spell schools. It can also be used as
a weapon.<localtiles> You can wield a staff by <w>left-clicking</w>.</localtiles>
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_GOLD

You have picked up your first pile of
gold<console> ('<yellow>$item[gold]</yellow>')</console>. Unlike most other
objects in Crawl it takes up no space in your inventory and can't be dropped.
Gold can be used to buy items from shops, and is appreciated by certain gods.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_STAIRS

These<console> '$1'</console> are downstairs. You can enter the next (deeper)
level by following them down (<w>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</w>). To return to this
level, press <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_UPSTAIRS]</w> while standing on the upstairs.

<localtiles>Alternatively, you can <w>left-click</w> on stairs you're standing
on to use them.</localtiles>
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_ESCAPE_HATCH

This<console> '$1'</console> is an escape hatch. You can use it to leave a
level with <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_UPSTAIRS]</w> and <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</w>
respectively<localtiles> (or by<w>left-clicking</w>)</localtiles>, like stairs;
unlike stairs, however, hatches are a one-way trip, so be careful when 
descending!
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_BRANCH

This<console> '$1'</console> is the entrance to a different branch of the
dungeon, which might have different terrain, level layout and monsters from the
current main branch you're in. Some branches contain only a single level, and
others are many levels deep. They can also contain entrances to other branches.

The first three branches you'll encounter are the Temple, the Lair and the
Orcish Mines. While the Lair and the Mines can be dangerous for the new
adventurer, the Temple is completely safe and contains a number of altars at
which you might convert to a new god.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_PORTAL

This<console> '$1'</console> is a portal to an optional level, offering extra
loot in exchange for extra danger. There's no penalty for skipping it, but the
portal will disappear if you wait, so you have to decide now if you want to risk
it. 
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_BAZAAR_PORTAL

This<console> '$1'</console> is a portal to an inter-dimensional bazaar filled
with shops. It will disappear if you don't enter it soon, so hurry.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_PORTAL_2

You can enter a portal just like a set of stairs, by standing on it and
<tiles><w>clicking</w></tiles><console>pressing
<w>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</w></console>. To return, find <tiles>a similar
looking portal.</tiles><console>another $1 - but NOT the ancient stone arch
you'll start out on!</console>
%%%%
HINT_STAIR_BRAND

<tiles>A small symbol on a stair tile signifies that there are items in that
position that you may want to check out.</tiles>
<console>If any items are covering stairs or an escape hatch, then that will
be indicated by highlighting the <w><<</w> or <w>></w> symbol, instead of hiding
the stair symbol with an item glyph.</console>
%%%%
HINT_HEAP_BRAND

<tiles>A small symbol on an item tile signifies that there is at least one other
item in the same heap that you may want to check out.</tiles>
<console>If two or more items are on a single square, then the square will be
highlighted, and the symbol for the item on the top of the heap will be shown.
</console>
%%%%
HINT_TRAP_BRAND

<console>If any items are covering a trap, then that will be indicated by 
highlighting the <w>^</w> symbol, instead of hiding the trap symbol with an item
glyph.</console>
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_TRAP

You just discovered a trap. You'll occasionally stumble into these nasty
constructions<console>, depicted by $1</console>. Each type of trap has a
different effect when stepped on, like alerting enemies or causing random
teleportation.
%%%%
HINT_TRIGGERED_TRAP

Oops... you just triggered a trap. You'll occasionally stumble into these nasty
constructions<console>, depicted by $1</console>. Each type of trap has a
different effect when stepped on, like alerting enemies or causing random
teleportation.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_ALTAR

That<console> $1</console> is an altar.

<nomouse>If you target the altar with <w>$cmd[CMD_LOOK_AROUND]</w>, then press
<w>$cmd[CMD_TARGET_DESCRIBE]</w></nomouse> you can get a short description.

Press <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_UPSTAIRS]</w> or <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</w> while
standing on the square to join the faith or read some information about the god
in question. Before taking up the corresponding faith you'll be asked for
confirmation.

{{
    if you.god() == "No God" and you.class() == "Conjurer" then
        return "The simplest god for an inexperienced conjurer is probably"
               .. " Vehumet, though Sif Muna is a good second choice."
