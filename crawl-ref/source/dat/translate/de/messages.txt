It was the word of Zin that there would not be @sin_noun@...

%%%%
...and did the people not suffer until they had @smitten@...

%%%%
...the @sinners@, after which all was well?

%%%%
The voice of Zin, pure and clear, did say that the @sinners@...

%%%%
...were not @virtuous@! And hearing this, the people rose up...

%%%%
...and embraced @virtue@, for they feared Zin's wrath.

%%%%
Zin spoke of the doctrine of @virtue@, and...

%%%%
...saw the @sinners@ filled with fear, for they were...

%%%%
...@sin_adj@ and knew Zin's wrath would come for them.

%%%%
And so Zin bade the @sinners@ to come before...

%%%%
...the altar, that judgement might be passed...

%%%%
...upon those who were not @virtuous@.

%%%%
To the devout, Zin provideth. From the rest...

%%%%
...ye @sinners@, ye guilty...

%%%%
...of @sin_noun@, Zin taketh.

%%%%
Zin saw the @sin_noun@ of the @sinners@, and...

%%%%
...was displeased, for did the law not say that...

%%%%
...those who did not become @virtuous@ would be @smitten@?

%%%%
Zin said that @virtue@ shall be the law of the land, and...

%%%%
...those who turn to @sin_noun@ will be @smitten@. This was fair...

%%%%
...and just, and not a voice dissented.

%%%%
Damned, damned be the @sinners@ and...

%%%%
...all else who abandon @virtue@! Let them...

%%%%
...be @smitten@ by the jurisprudence of Zin!

%%%%
And Zin said to all in attendance, 'Which of ye...

%%%%
...number among the @sinners@? Come before me, that...

%%%%
...I may @smite@ you now for your @sin_noun@!'

%%%%
Yea, I say unto thee, bring forth...

%%%%
...the @sinners@ that they may know...

%%%%
...the wrath of Zin, and thus be @smitten@!

%%%%
In a great set of silver scales are weighed the...

%%%%
...souls of the @sinners@, and with their @sin_adj@...

%%%%
...ways, the balance hath tipped against them!

%%%%
It is just that the @sinners@ shall be @smitten@...

%%%%
...in due time, for @virtue@ is what Zin has declared...

%%%%
...the law of the land, and Zin's word is law!

%%%%
Thus the people made the covenant of @virtue@ with...

%%%%
...Zin, and all was good, for they knew that the...

%%%%
...@sinners@ would trouble them no longer.

%%%%
What of the @sinners@? @Smitten@ for their...

%%%%
...@sin_noun@ they shall be! Zin will @smite@ them again...

%%%%
...and again, and again!

%%%%
And lo, the wrath of Zin did find...

%%%%
...them wherever they hid, and the @sinners@...

%%%%
...were @smitten@ for their @sin_noun@!

%%%%
Zin looked out upon the remains of the @sinners@...

%%%%
...and declared it good that they had been...

%%%%
...@smitten@. And thus justice was done.

%%%%
The law of Zin demands thee...

%%%%
...be @virtuous@, and that the punishment for @sin_noun@...

%%%%
...shall be swift and harsh!

%%%%
It was then that Zin bade them...

%%%%
...not to stray from @virtue@, lest...

%%%%
...they become as damned as the @sinners@.

%%%%
Only the @virtuous@ shall be judged worthy, and...

%%%%
...all the @sinners@ will be found wanting. Such is...

%%%%
...the word of Zin, and such is the law!

%%%%
To those who would swear an oath of @virtue@ on my altar...

%%%%
...I bring ye salvation. To the rest, ye @sinners@...

%%%%
...and the @sin_adj@, the name of Zin shall be thy damnation.

%%%%
And Zin decreed that the people would be...

%%%%
...protected from @sin_noun@ in all its forms, and...

%%%%
...preserved in their @virtue@ for all the days to come.

%%%%
For those who would enter Zin's holy bosom...

%%%%
...and live in @virtue@, Zin provideth. Such is...

%%%%
...the covenant, and such is the way of things.

%%%%
Zin hath not damned the @sinners@, but it is they...

%%%%
...that have damned themselves for their @sin_noun@, for...

%%%%
...did Zin not decree that to be @sin_adj@ was wrong?

%%%%
And Zin, furious at their @sin_noun@, held...

%%%%
...aloft a silver sceptre! The @sinners@...

%%%%
...were @smitten@, and thus the way of things was maintained.

%%%%
When the law of the land faltered, Zin rose...

%%%%
...from the silver throne, and the @sinners@ were...

%%%%
...@smitten@. And it was thus that the law was made good.

%%%%
Zin descended from on high in a silver chariot...

%%%%
...to @smite@ the @sinners@ for their...

%%%%
...@sin_noun@, and thus judgement was rendered.

%%%%
The @sinners@ stood before Zin, and in that instant...

%%%%
...they knew they would be found guilty of @sin_noun@...

%%%%
...for that is the word of Zin, and Zin's word is law.

Remember to rest between fights and to enter unexplored terrain with full health and magic. Ideally you should retreat into areas you've already explored and cleared of monsters; resting on the edge of the explored terrain increases the chances of your rest being interrupted by wandering monsters. For resting, press <w>5</w> or <w>Shift-numpad 5</w><tiles>, or <w>click the rest button</w></tiles>.

%%%%
\nAlso, berserking might help you not to lose so much health in the first place. To use your abilities type <w>a</w>.

"That "

" is a monster, usually depicted by a letter. Some typical early monsters look like <brown>r</brown>, <green>l</green>, <brown>K</brown> or <lightgrey>g</lightgrey>. "

%%%%
"You can gain information about it by pressing <w>x</w> and moving the cursor over the monster, and read the monster description by then pressing <w>v</w>. "

%%%%
"\nTo attack this monster with your wielded weapon, just move into it. "

%%%%
Note that as long as there's a non-friendly monster in view you won't be able to automatically move to distant squares, to avoid death by misclicking.

%%%%
"However, as a hunter you will want to deal with it using your bow. If you have a look at your shortbow from your <w>i</w>nventory, you'll find an explanation of how to do this. "

%%%%
First <w>w</w>ield it, then follow the instructions.<tiles>\nAs a short-cut you can also <w>right-click</w> on your shortbow to read its description, and <w>left-click</w> to wield it.</tiles>

%%%%
<tiles>Clicking with your <w>right mouse button</w> on your shortbow will also let you read its description.</tiles>

"is a portal to an optional level, offering extra loot in exchange for extra danger. There's no penalty for skipping it, but the portal will disappear if you wait, so you have to decide now if you want to risk it. "

%%%%
\nYou should probably stick with axes. Checking other axes' enchantments can be worthwhile, but weapons can be cursed and difficult to remove, so unless you have a scroll of remove curse, only wield weapons you're ready to be stuck with!

%%%%
This is the first stack of missiles <console>('<w>

\nAs you're already trained in Bows, you only need to bother collecting arrows.

%%%%
\nHowever, as a spellslinger, you don't really need another type of ranged attack.

%%%%
\nFor now you might be best off with sticking to stones for ranged attacks.

Some branches contain only a single level, and others are many levels deep.

Congratulations, your character just gained experience by killing this monster! This will raise some of your skills, making you more deadly.

%%%%
" Also, most kills will grant you favour in the eyes of Trog."

%%%%
Well done! Reaching a new experience level is always a nice event: you get more health and magic points, and occasionally increases to your attributes: strength, intelligence, and dexterity.

%%%%
\nGaining an experience level also lets you learn more difficult spells. You can memorise a second spell with <w>%</w>

%%%%
Being skilled in a magical "school" makes it easier to learn and cast spells of that school. Many spells belong to a combination of several schools, in which case the average skill in these schools will determine spellcasting success and power.

%%%%
Being skilled with a particular type of weapon will make you deal slightly more damage and attack significantly faster with all weapons of that type. It's a good idea to focus on just one weapon type, usually one you start with, though finding a particularly good weapon may justify a switch.

%%%%
Being skilled in a particular type of ranged attack will let you deal more damage when using the appropriate weapons. It is usually best to concentrate on one type of ranged attack (including spells), and to use a melee weapon as a backup for fighting weak enemies.

%%%%
Every third level, you get to choose an attribute to raise: strength, intelligence, or dexterity.\n<w>Strength</w> makes heavy armour less cumbersome and slightly increases weapon damage.\n<w>Intelligence</w> makes your spells more reliable and powerful.\n<w>Dexterity</w> increases your evasion and stealth.

%%%%
Enchantments of all types can befall you temporarily. Brief descriptions of these appear at the lower end of the stats area. Press <w>%</w> for more details. You can search for full enchantment descriptions by pressing <w>%/T</w>.

%%%%
Poison will slowly reduce your health. You can wait it out with <w>%</w>, if you're in combat or lethally poisoned, you'll probably want to quaff a potion of curing.

%%%%
Cursed equipment, once worn or wielded, cannot be dropped or removed. Scrolls of remove curse will remove all curses from your current equipment.

%%%%
The curses on your worn equipment have been removed, so you can now unequip any previously cursed items.

%%%%
"There are a lot of items here. You choose what to pick up from a menu: type <w>%</w> "

%%%%
"or <w>click</w> on the player doll "

%%%%
to enter the pickup menu. To leave the menu, confirm your selection with <w>Enter</w>.

%%%%
Sadly, your inventory is limited to 52 items, and it appears your knapsack is full.

%%%%
" However, this is easy enough to rectify: simply <w>%</w>rop some of the stuff you don't need right now."

%%%%
" In the drop menu you can then comfortably select which items to drop by pressing their inventory letter, or by clicking on them."

%%%%
Walking around takes fewer keystrokes if you press <w>Shift-direction</w> or <w>/ direction</w>. That will let you run until a monster comes into sight or your character sees something interesting.

%%%%
As you explore a level, orientation can become difficult. Press <w>%</w> to bring up the level map. Typing <w>?</w> shows the list of level map commands. Most importantly, moving the cursor to a spot and pressing <w>.</w> or <w>Enter</w> lets your character move there on its own.

%%%%
\nAlso, clicking on the right-side minimap with your <w>right mouse button</w> will zoom into that dungeon area. Clicking with the <w>left mouse button</w> instead will let you move there.

%%%%
Fully exploring a level and picking up all the interesting looking items can be tedious. To save on this tedium you can press <w>%</w> to auto-explore, which will automatically explore unmapped regions, automatically pick up interesting items, and stop if a monster or interesting dungeon feature (stairs, altar, etc.) is encountered.

%%%%
"Hey, you've finished exploring the dungeon on this level! You can search for stairs from the level map (<w>%</w>) by pressing <w>></w>. The cursor will jump to the nearest staircase, and by pressing <w>.</w> or <w>Enter</w> your character can move there, too. Each level of Crawl has three "

%%%%
"up and three "

%%%%
down stairs. Unexplored parts can often be accessed via another level.

%%%%
\nTo prevent autotravel or autoexplore taking you into dangerous territory, you can set travel exclusions by entering the map view (<w>%</w>) and then toggling the exclusion radius on the monster position with <w>e</w>. To make this easier some immobile monsters listed in the <w>auto_exclude</w> option (such as this one) are considered dangerous enough to warrant an automatic setting of an exclusion. It will be automatically cleared if you manage to kill the monster. You could also manually remove the exclusion with <w>%ee</w> but unless you remove this monster from the auto_exclude list, the exclusion will be reset the next turn.

%%%%
Your health is getting dangerously low. Retreating and/or quaffing a potion of heal wounds or curing might be a good idea.

%%%%
If you're low on health or magic and there's no urgent need to move, you can rest for a bit. Ideally, you should retreat to an area you've already explored and cleared of monsters before resting, since resting on the edge of the explored terrain increases the risk of rest being interrupted by a wandering monster. Press <w>%</w> or <w>shift-numpad-5</w>

%%%%
, or click on the 'rest' button,

%%%%
" to do so."

%%%%
You are lethally poisoned, so now would be a good time to <w>%</w>uaff a potion of heal wounds or, better yet, a potion of curing. If you have seen neither of these so far, try unknown potions in your inventory. Good luck!

%%%%
Fighting against a monster you cannot see is difficult. If you don't have a source of see invisibility, you can find invisible monsters by luring them into shallow water, opaque clouds (from a scroll of fog), or a corridor, where their movements will be more predictable. If things go south, try teleporting out, or leaving the level entirely!

%%%%
You recently noticed an invisible monster, so unless you killed it or left the scene resting might not be safe. If you still need to replenish your health or magic, you'll have to quaff an appropriate potion. For normal resting you will first have to get away from the danger.

%%%%
Against particularly difficult foes, you should use your Berserk <w>%</w>bility. Killing monsters while berserking makes it last longer.

%%%%
Berserking is extremely exhausting! Afterwards you are slowed down and occasionally even pass out. You won't be able to berserk again until enough time passes for your exhaustion to fade.

%%%%
Whenever your health is very low and you're in danger of dying, check your options carefully. Often, retreat or use of some item might be a viable alternative to fighting on.

%%%%
" As a four-legged centaur, you are particularly quick - running away is usually an option!"

%%%%
"With "

%%%%
" support you can use your Berserk ability (<w>%</w>) to temporarily gain more health and greater strength. Bear in mind that berserking at the last minute is often risky, and prevents you from using items to escape!"

%%%%
" If retreating to another level, keep in mind that monsters may follow you if they're standing right next to you when you start climbing or descending the stairs. And even if you've managed to shake them off, they'll still be there when you come back, so you might want to use a different set of stairs when you return."

%%%%
Without magical power you're unable to cast spells. While melee is a possibility, that's not where your strengths lie, so retreat (if possible) might be the better option.

%%%%
\n\nOr you could e<w>%</w>oke a wand to deal damage.

"Miscasting a spell can have nasty consequences, particularly for the more difficult spells. Your chance of successfully casting a spell increases with your magic skills, and can also be improved with the help of some items. Use the <w>%</w> command "

"or mouse over the spell tiles "

%%%%
to check your current failure rates.

Wearing heavy body armour or using a shield, especially a large one, can severely hamper your spellcasting abilities. You can check the effect of this by comparing the failure rates on the <w>%\?</w> screen with and without the item being worn.\n\n

%%%%
If the spellcasting success chance is high (which can be checked by entering <w>%\?</w> or <w>%</w>) then a miscast merely means the spell is not working, along with a harmless side effect. However, for spells with a high failure rate, there's a chance of contaminating yourself with magical energy, plus a chance of an additional harmful side effect. Normally this isn't a problem, since magical contamination bleeds off over time, but if you're repeatedly contaminated in a short amount of time you'll mutate or suffer from other ill side effects.\n\n

%%%%
Note that a miscast spell will still consume the full amount of MP that a successfully cast spell would.

%%%%
"You've accumulated so much magical contamination that you're glowing! You usually acquire magical contamination from using some powerful magics, like invisibility, or from miscasting spells. "

%%%%
"As long as the status only shows in grey nothing will actually happen as a result of it, but as you continue suffusing yourself with magical contamination you'll eventually start glowing for real, which "

if you have appropriate ammo quivered you can <w>left mouse click</w> on the monster while prssing the <w>Shift key</w>. Alternatively, you can <w>left mouse click</w> on the tile for the ammo you wish to fire, and then <w>left mouse click</w> on the monster.\n\n

"like this are much more likely to be of higher "

enchantment or have special properties, good or bad.

%%%%
\n\nOnce wielded, a cursed weapon can't be unwielded until the curse has been lifted by reading a scroll of remove curse.

" can be <w>%</w>ired without the use of a launcher. "

%%%%
"As you're already wielding the appropriate launcher, you can simply "

%%%%
"To shoot "

%%%%
, first you need to <w>%</w>ield an appropriate launcher.

%%%%
As a Centaur you cannot wear boots. (Type <w>%</w> to see a list of your mutations and innate abilities.)

%%%%
As a Minotaur you cannot wear helmets. (Type <w>%</w> to see a list of your mutations and innate abilities.)

%%%%
Only nagas and palentongas can wear barding.

%%%%
You can wear pieces of armour with <w>%</w> and take them off again with <w>%</w>

%%%%
, or, alternatively, simply click on their tiles to perform either action

%%%%
\nNote that body armour with a high encumbrance rating may hinder your ability to cast spells. Light armour such as robes and leather armour will be generally safe for any aspiring spellcaster.

%%%%
\nNote that shields will hinder your ability to cast spells, until you've gained enough Shields skill to remove the penalty.

%%%%
\nNote that many ranged weapons are two handed and so cannot be used with a shield.

%%%%
\nA cursed piece of armour, once worn, cannot be removed again until the curse has been lifted by reading a scroll of remove curse.

%%%%
\n\nThis armour offers its wearer protection from certain sources. For an overview of your resistances (among other things) type <w>%</w>

%%%%
"\n\nWhen worn, some types of armour (such as this one) offer certain <w>%</w>bilities you can activate. "

%%%%
The magic within can be unleashed by evoking (<w>%</w>) it.

%%%%
" Alternatively, you can 1) <w>left mouse click</w> on the monster you wish to target (or your player character to target yourself) while pressing the <w>"

%%%%
Ctrl + Shift keys

%%%%
Alt key

%%%%
</w> and pick the wand from the menu, or 2) <w>left mouse click</w> on the wand tile and then <w>left mouse click</w> on your target.

%%%%
Type <w>%</w> to read this scroll

%%%%
or simply click on it with your <w>left mouse button</w>

%%%%
Jewellery can be <w>%</w>ut on or <w>%</w>emoved again

%%%%
, though in Tiles, either can be done by clicking on the item in your inventory

%%%%
\nA cursed piece of jewellery will stick to its wearer when equipped, and cannot be removed until you read a scroll of remove curse.

%%%%
"\n\nThis "

%%%%
" offers its wearer protection from certain sources. For an overview of your resistances (among other things) type <w>%</w>"

%%%%
"\n\nWhen worn, some types of jewellery (such as this one) offer certain <w>%</w>bilities you can activate. "

%%%%
Type <w>%</w> to quaff this potion

%%%%
A manual can greatly help you in training a skill. As long as you are carrying it, the skill in question will be trained more efficiently and will level up faster.

%%%%
\nIt's a book, you can pick it up to add its spells to your spell library. (View your spell  library with <w>%</w>

%%%%
Skeletons and corpses can be used as components for certain necromantic spells. Apart from that, they are largely useless.

%%%%
"This staff can enhance your spellcasting, possibly making a certain spell school more powerful, or making difficult magic easier to cast. "

%%%%
It also offers its wielder protection from certain sources. For an overview of your resistances (among other things) type <w>%</w>

%%%%
"\n\nSeeing how "

%%%%
" frowns upon the use of magic, this staff will be of little use to you and you might just as well <w>%</w>rop it now."

%%%%
Miscellaneous items sometimes harbour magical powers that can be harnessed by e<w>%</w>oking the item.

%%%%
\n<

%%%%
It's just a harmless statue - or is it?\nEven if not a danger by themselves, statues often mark special areas, dangerous ones or ones harbouring treasure.

%%%%
These nasty constructions can cause a range of unpleasant effects. You won't be able to avoid tripping traps by flying over them; their magic construction will cause them to be triggered anyway.

%%%%
The dungeon contains a number of natural obstacles such as shafts, which lead one to three levels down. Once you know the shaft is there, you can safely step over it.\nIf you want to jump down there, use <w>></w> to do so. Be warned that getting back here might be difficult.

%%%%
"Some areas of the dungeon, such as the Spider Nest, may be strewn with giant webs that may ensnare you for a short time and notify nearby spiders of your location. Players in Spider Form can safely navigate the webs (as can incorporeal entities and various oozes). "

%%%%
You can enter the next (deeper) level by following them down (<w>></w>). To get back to this level again, press <w><<</w> while standing on the upstairs.

%%%%
" In Tiles, you can achieve the same, in either direction, by clicking the <w>left mouse button</w>."

%%%%
"\n\nYou have not yet passed through this particular set of stairs. "

%%%%
These stairs lead out of the dungeon. Following them will end the game. The only way to win is to transport the fabled Orb of Zot outside.

%%%%
You can enter the previous (shallower) level by following these up (<w><<</w>). This is ideal for retreating or finding a safe resting spot, since the previous level will have less monsters, and monsters on this level can't follow you up unless they're standing right next to you. To get back to this level again, press <w>></w> while standing on the downstairs.

%%%%
" In Tiles, you can perform either action simply by clicking the <w>left mouse button</w> instead."

%%%%
Escape hatches can be used to quickly leave a level with <w><<</w> and <w>></w>, respectively. Note that you will usually be unable to return right away.

%%%%
\nTo avoid accidentally opening a door you'd rather remain closed during travel or autoexplore, you can mark it with an exclusion from the map view (<w>X</w>) with <w>ee</w> while your cursor is on the grid in question. Such an exclusion will prevent autotravel from ever entering that grid until you remove the exclusion with another press of <w>Xe</w>.

%%%%
This is your chance to join a religion! In general, the gods will help their followers, bestowing powers of all sorts upon them, but many of them demand a life of dedication, constant tributes or entertainment in return.\nYou can get information about <w>

%%%%
</w> by pressing <w>></w> while standing on the altar. Before taking up the responding faith you'll be asked for confirmation.

%%%%
" probably won't like it if you switch allegiance, but having a look won't hurt: to get information on <w>"

%%%%
"</w>, press <w>></w> while standing on the altar. Before taking up the responding faith (and abandoning your current one!) you'll be asked for confirmation.\nTo see your current standing with "

%%%%
" press <w>^</w>"

%%%%
, or click with your <w>right mouse button</w> on your avatar while pressing <w>Shift</w>

%%%%
"An entryway into one of the many dungeon side branches in Crawl. "

%%%%
Beware, sometimes these can be deadly!

%%%%
Many forms of combat will spatter the surroundings with blood (if the victim has any, that is). Some monsters, like jackals or vampires, can smell blood from a distance and may come looking.

%%%%
"The "

%%%%
"are "

%%%%
"is "

%%%%
"harmless. "

%%%%
"probably dangerous, and you should stay out of it if you can. "

%%%%
currently harmless, but that could change at some point. Check the overview screen (<w>%</w>) to view your resistances.

%%%%
\nThis cloud

%%%%
It

%%%%
" is opaque. If two or more opaque clouds are between you and a square, you won't be able to see anything in that square."

%%%%
The strange disturbance means that there's a monster hiding under the surface of the shallow water. Submerged monsters will not be autotargeted when doing a ranged attack while there are other, visible targets in sight. Of course you can still target it manually if you wish to.

%%%%
Did you think you were the only adventurer in the dungeon? Well, you thought wrong! These unique adversaries often possess skills that normal monsters wouldn't, so be careful.\n\n

%%%%
The ghost of a deceased adventurer, it would like nothing better than to send you the same way.\n\n

%%%%
"This monster is a demon of the "

%%%%
highest

%%%%
second-highest

%%%%
middle

%%%%
second-lowest

%%%%
lowest

%%%%
" tier.\n\n"

%%%%
This monster appears to be really dangerous!\n

%%%%
This monster appears to be quite dangerous.\n

%%%%
A berserking monster is bloodthirsty and fighting madly. Such a blood rage makes it particularly dangerous!\n\n

%%%%
Friendly monsters will follow you around and attempt to aid you in battle. You can order nearby allies by <w>t</w>alking to them.

%%%%
\n\nHowever, it is only <w>temporarily</w> friendly, and will become dangerous again when this friendliness wears off.

%%%%
You can easily mark its square as dangerous to avoid accidentally entering into its field of view when using auto-explore or auto-travel. To do so, enter targeting mode with <w>x</w> and then press <w>e</w> when your cursor is hovering over the monster's grid. Doing so will mark this grid and all surrounding ones within a radius of 8 as "excluded" ones that explore or travel modes won't enter.

%%%%
This might be a good time to run away

%%%%
" or apply your Berserk <w>a</w>bility"

%%%%
Apparently it has not noticed you - yet. Note that you do not have to engage every monster you meet. Sometimes, discretion is the better part of valour.

%%%%
Apparently it has been distracted by something. You could use this opportunity to sneak up on this monster - or to sneak away.

%%%%
\nThis monster doesn't appear to have any resistances or susceptibilities. It cannot fly and is of average speed. Examining other, possibly more high-level monsters can give important clues as to how to deal with them.
